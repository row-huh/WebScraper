# WebScraper
This is a special script made with Selenium. It finds books using their special ISBN numbers, checks their prices on different book websites, and then compares them. Great for helping book-selling websites understand the market better!

The script asks you the book name which you wish to search

It then searches a website, In this case, it's using https://www.libertybooks.com/
and formats the search results into a csv file classified in the columns of "book_title", "author_name" and "price"
